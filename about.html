          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>
            “EDX provides cost effective and technologically advanced wireless network planning, design and management software tools for both outdoor and indoor settings, across all frequency bands, and in support of advanced air interface standards.”
          </p> 

          <h2>History Of Our Name</h2>
          <p>
            The three letters “EDX” is a registered trademark of EDX Wireless, Inc. This name is a combination of the letter “E” which represents the word “equivalent” and “DX” which is the radio Morse code abbreviation for “distance”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harry Anderson, the founder of EDX began writing radio design software programs for personal computers in the 1980’s. One of his first programs was named “EDX”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program predicted groundwave field strength at a distance for medium wave (550-1600KHz) transmitters. He liked the combination of the letters and decided to also name his company EDX. The EDX program integrated the ground conductivity tables found in the rules of the Federal Communications Commission. These tables contain families of curves for a variety of ground conductivities. When a radio signal travels across the earth it can encounter multiple areas (zones) of varied ground conductivity. In order to account for these transitions from one conductivity zone to another, the Equivalent Distance Method simply assumes that the signal at the end of a preceding zone determines the amplitude of the signal (from an imaginary transmitter) at the beginning of the new zone. This is described in the FCC rules (47CFR73.183(d)).

                 Dr.  Blumberg is responsible for all aspects of software architecture and programming. Dr. Blumberg retains special skills in numerical methods and graphics programming. Dr. Blumberg, who joined EDX in 1998, has held a variety of research and software development positions since 1973, including roles at Hewlett Packard, Stanford Research Institute, Perkin Elmer, Signetics, and Fairchild Semiconductor. Prior to EDX, he worked in Symantec’s project management organization. Dr. Blumberg’s research led to his developing new computational methods for solving quantum mechanical problems in amorphous solids, and solutions to Schrödinger’s equation employing supercomputers using sparse matrix methods, Gaussian quadrature, and orthogonal polynomials. He attended Cambridge University as a visiting scholar, and was conferred a Battelle Energy Research Fellowship. Dr. Blumberg was awarded the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Oregon, and earned the B.A. in physics at Harvard College.
